// when you change Test 2 to test 2 you get "exit status 1"
public class Test2
{
  public static void main() //when you replace main with man it gives you exit status 1 and 1 error.
  {
    // when you change println to bogus, it gives you exit status 1 and 1 error
    // when you remove the semi colon after the print it gives you exit status 1 and 1 error
    System.out.println("An Emergency Broadcast"); // when you remove the first quotation in the string, there 2 errors and it says exit status 1
    //when you remove the last quotation in the string, there is an error and it says exit status 1

    // when you change Emergency to emergency, there are no errors because you are just changing how the output looks like. but it changes the case of the text that is printed
  }
}
// when you remove the braces at the end it gives you exit status 1 and 1 error
